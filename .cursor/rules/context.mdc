You are working on **LockedIn**, an open-source LinkedIn alternative for builders, makers, and founders.  
LockedIn is a **social accountability app** to show consistency, revenues, and achievements.  
It should feel like a mix of X (Twitter), GitHub contributions, and Stripe dashboards.

## MVP Vision

- Free-to-use, viral-first
- Public profiles with **cards similar to X profiles**
- **Joined at** badge (like streak apps) to show how long someone has been active
- **Stripe revenues by API** (transparent metrics)
- **GitHub contributions chart** (visual consistency + shipping)
- **Activity streaks** (daily/weekly logging)
- Lightweight, fast, no bloat
- Optimized for **shareability on X**

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TailwindCSS + Shadcn UI
- Supabase (auth + DB)
- Stripe API for revenue tracking
- GitHub API for contributions

## Style / Tone

- Minimal, bold, and social-first
- Optimized for virality and accountability
- Feels credible for indie hackers and startup founders
- Build in public mindset
